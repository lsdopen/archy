1. The Archy webhook is now installed and will automatically:
   - Inspect container image manifests to determine supported architectures
   - Add kubernetes.io/arch nodeSelector to Pods when a single common architecture is found
   - Allow scheduler flexibility when multiple architectures are supported
   - Reject Pods when no common architecture exists (fail-safe behavior)

2. Check the webhook status:
   kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration {{ include "archy.fullname" . }}
   kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "{{ include "archy.selectorLabels" . }}"

3. View webhook logs:
   kubectl logs -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "{{ include "archy.selectorLabels" . }}" -f

4. Test webhook connectivity:
   kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ include "archy.fullname" . }} 8443:443
   curl -k https://localhost:8443/healthz

5. The webhook will process all new Pod creations except:
   - Pods in kube-system and kube-public namespaces
   - Pods with the label app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "archy.name" . }}
   - Pods that already have a nodeSelector defined
